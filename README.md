# Project Title
## About the Project
### Goals
What is the purpose of the project? This project is guidance for users creating an informative readme file for any project. This can be used directly or as inspiration. Tailor it to the needs of the project. Sections can be added or removed.

### Background
Domain knowledge relevant to project. According to [WiseGeek.com](https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-readme-file.htm),
> "A readme file is a text file that is often included with software that contains general information or instructions about the software. The specific nature of 
> this information varies significantly from file to file...There is no general formula for writing a readme, however, and in the end the content depends on 
> the whims of the developer."

### Deliverables
The requirements for sharing your project. If possible, include links, such as the link to a presentation.

### Acknowledgments
Where you got the data, inspiration, etc. 
> Inspiration for all my Readme files from Maggie Giust's Heart Failure repository [here](https://github.com/magsgiust/heart_failure).
